# A simple google maps extension that adds an estimated trip cost

I am brand new to web dev and this is my crash course in javascript

### Planned Changes
* update options page layout (1)
  * form that is already filled in with user data
  * easier to change and see changes
* remove content script check for URL, only run on google.com/maps/dir* (change in manifest.json) (2)
* is the content.js load event listener necessary? (2)
  * [info 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/readystatechange_event)
  * [info 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/readyState)
* learn about webpack (do I even need it) (4)
* add packages? hehe new functionality (4)
* do a security check (3)
